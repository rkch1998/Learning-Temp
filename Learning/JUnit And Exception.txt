Custom Exception

1.A custom exception, also known as a user-defined exception, 
	an exception that you define in your Java code to handle 
	specific error conditions that are not covered by built-in 
	exceptions. 
2.Creating custom exceptions allows you to add more context to 
	the error messages and handle exceptional situations that are 
	specific to your application domain.
	
3.Define a Custom Exception Class:
	* Create a new class that extends either Exception (for checked exceptions) 
		or RuntimeException (for unchecked exceptions).
	* Implement constructors to provide flexibility in initializing the exception 
		with custom error messages or additional information.
4.Throw the Custom Exception:
	* Use the throw keyword to throw an instance of your custom exception 
		when a specific error condition occurs in your code.
	* Provide a meaningful error message or additional context to aid in 
		debugging and troubleshooting.
5.Handle the Custom Exception:
	* Catch the custom exception using a try-catch block wherever the method 
		that throws the exception is called.


Explain the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?

* An exception in Java is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, 
	disrupting the normal flow of instructions.
* Exceptions represent abnormal or unexpected conditions that require special 
	handling to ensure the smooth execution of the program.
	
* Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time, meaning the compiler ensures 
	that they are either caught using a try-catch block or declared in the 
	method signature using the throws keyword.

* Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time, meaning the compiler 
	does not enforce any handling requirements for them.
	
* Checked exceptions must be either caught using a try-catch block or declared 
	in the method signature using the throws keyword.
* The compiler enforces this requirement to ensure that potential errors are 
	not ignored and are handled appropriately by the developer.

* Unchecked exceptions do not need to be caught or declared in the method signature.
* They are not checked by the compiler at compile time, allowing them to propagate up 
	the call stack until they are caught or cause the program to terminate.
	
* Examples of checked exceptions include IOException, SQLException, and ClassNotFoundException.

* Examples of unchecked exceptions include NullPointerException, ClassCastException,
	ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
	
Why does a finally block execute even after a return statement in the try block?

* In Java, the finally block is used to define cleanup code that should be executed regardless 
	of whether an exception occurs in the try block or not.
* This ensures that resources are properly released, even if an exception is thrown or caught 
	within the try block. The finally block executes after the try block completes its 
	execution, whether normally or due to an exception, and before control is transferred 
	to the caller.
	
* The reason why a finally block executes even after a return statement in the try block is 
	because the finally block is designed to always execute, irrespective of how the try block 
	exits.

* Cleanup: The purpose of the finally block is to perform cleanup operations, such as 
				releasing resources, closing files, or releasing locks, which need to 
				be executed regardless of how the try block exits (whether by normal 
				completion, an exception, or a return statement).
* Exception Handling: If an exception is thrown in the try block and caught by a catch 
						block, the finally block still executes after the catch block 
						completes its execution. This ensures that cleanup operations 
						are performed even if an exception occurs.
						

What is try-catch-finally block in Java?

* In Java, the try-catch-finally block is used for exception handling.
* It allows developers to write code that handles exceptional conditions 
	gracefully and ensures proper cleanup of resources, regardless of 
	whether an exception occurs or not. 
* The try-catch-finally block consists of three main components:
	1. try Block:
		* The try block contains the code that may potentially throw an exception.
		* It is the block where the program attempts to execute the potentially risky code.
		* If an exception occurs within the try block, control is transferred to the 
			corresponding catch block.
	2. catch Block(s):
		* The catch block(s) follow the try block and specify how to handle different 
			types of exceptions that may occur.
		* Each catch block is associated with a specific type of exception, allowing 
			the program to handle different exceptions differently.
		* If an exception of the corresponding type is thrown within the try block, 
			control is transferred to the corresponding catch block for handling.
	3. finally Block:
		* The finally block follows the catch block(s) (if present) and contains code 
			that should be executed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.
		* It is typically used for cleanup operations, such as closing files, releasing 
			resources, or releasing locks.
		* The finally block executes even if an exception is thrown and caught, and even 
			if a return, break, or continue statement is encountered within the try or 
			catch blocks.
			

How do you handle exceptions when working with Java's Stream API?

* When working with Java's Stream API, exceptions can occur during 
	the processing of elements in the stream. Handling exceptions 
	in Stream operations requires careful consideration to ensure 
	that exceptions are appropriately caught, handled, or propagated.
	
* Using try-catch Inside Stream Operations:
	* You can use a try-catch block inside the stream's map, flatMap, forEach, 
		or other intermediate or terminal operations to catch exceptions locally.
	* This approach allows you to handle exceptions for each element individually, 
		but it may lead to verbose code.
	* Verbose Code:
		- Verbose code refers to code that is unnecessarily long, wordy, or 
			complicated, often containing redundant or repetitive elements 
			that make it difficult to read, understand, and maintain. 
		- Verbose code tends to lack clarity, conciseness, and simplicity, 
			making it harder for developers to comprehend and debug.

* Exception Propagation:
	* You can catch exceptions locally and rethrow them as unchecked exceptions, 
		such as RuntimeExceptions, using the throw keyword.
	* This approach propagates exceptions to the caller, allowing them to handle 
		or propagate the exceptions further up the call stack.
		
* Handling Exceptions in Stream Collectors:
	* When collecting stream elements into a collection, you can use a custom 
		Collector that handles exceptions during the accumulation process.
	* This approach allows you to encapsulate exception handling logic within 
		the Collector, providing a cleaner and more reusable solution.
		
* Using Optional to Handle Exceptions:
	* When transforming stream elements, you can use the map operation followed 
		by map or flatMap to convert elements to Optional and handle exceptions.
		
		
How do you test private methods or members of a class in JUnit?

* Testing private methods or members of a class in JUnit can be challenging because 
	JUnit is designed to test the public API of classes. 
* However, there are several approaches you can use to test private methods or members 
	indirectly:
	* Refactor the Code:
		* If possible, refactor the code to make the private methods or members 
			package-private or protected instead of private. 
		* This allows them to be accessed by test classes in the same package or 
			subclasses, respectively.
	* Use Reflection:
		* You can use Java's Reflection API to access and invoke private methods or members. 
		* While this approach is powerful, it is also more complex and may be less efficient.
	* Testing via Public Methods:
		* Test the behavior of the private methods indirectly by testing the public methods 
			that call them. 
		* If the public methods exhibit the expected behavior, it implies that the private 
			methods are functioning correctly.
	* Extract Private Methods to Separate Classes:
		* If the private methods contain significant logic that warrants testing, consider 
			refactoring them into separate classes with package-private or protected visibility. 
		* You can then test these classes directly.
	* Testability Improvements:
		* Aim to write testable code from the beginning by focusing on encapsulation, 
			dependency injection, and separation of concerns. 
		* This reduces the need to test private methods directly.
		
How do you check if a test method throws an Exception in JUnit?

* In JUnit, you can use annotations and assertions to check if a test method throws an exception. 
* There are multiple ways to achieve this, depending on the version of JUnit we are using and 
	specific requirements.

* Using @Test Annotation with expected Attribute (JUnit 4):
	* In JUnit 4, you can use the @Test annotation's expected attribute to specify the 
		expected exception that should be thrown by the test method. 
	* If the test method throws the specified exception or its subtype, the test passes.	
	
* Using @Test Annotation with assertThrows Method (JUnit 5):
	* In JUnit 5, you can use the assertThrows method from the Assertions class to assert 
		that a specific exception is thrown by the test method. 
	* This method takes the expected exception type and a Executable lambda representing 
		the code that should throw the exception.

* Using Try-Catch Block (JUnit 4 or JUnit 5):
	* You can also use a try-catch block within the test method to catch the exception and 
		then use assertions to verify its type and message.
		
		
Explain the difference between using Mockito.spy() and Mockito.mock() methods.

* Mockito.spy() and Mockito.mock() are both methods provided by the Mockito framework 
	for creating test doubles (mocks) of objects in unit tests. 
* However, they serve different purposes and behave differently.

* Mockito.mock() is used to create a mock object of a class or interface. 
* Mock objects are fake implementations of the original class or interface, 
	used to simulate behavior for testing purposes.
	
* Mockito.spy() is used to create a spy object of a real object. 
* Spy objects are partially mock objects that delegate calls to the real methods of 
	the original object, but allow you to stub or verify specific methods as needed.
	
* When you mock an object using Mockito.mock(), Mockito creates a lightweight proxy 
	object that simulates the behavior of the original class or interface. 
* By default, all methods of the mock object return default values (null for objects, 
	0 for primitives, and false for booleans).
	
* When you spy on an object using Mockito.spy(), Mockito creates a proxy object that 
	wraps the original object. 
* Calls to the spy object delegate to the real methods of the original object unless 
	stubbed otherwise. 
* You can use Mockito's stubbing and verification features on spy objects.

* You typically use Mockito.mock() to replace dependencies of the class under test, 
	allowing you to isolate the class and focus on testing its behavior in isolation.
*You typically use Mockito.spy() when you want to test the behavior of a real object 
	but need to modify or verify specific methods. 
* Spy objects are useful for testing legacy code or classes with complex dependencies.


What are the limitations of using Mockito, and how do you work around them?

* While Mockito is a powerful and versatile mocking framework for Java unit testing, 
	it has certain limitations.
	
	1. Inability to Mock Static Methods and Final Classes:
	Limitation: 
		* Mockito cannot mock static methods or final classes, as it relies on runtime code 
			generation and dynamic proxies, which do not support mocking static methods or 
			final classes.
	Workaround:
		* Extract the static or final methods into separate non-static or non-final methods 
			within a class, then mock the non-static/non-final methods.
		* Use a different mocking library such as PowerMock or JMockit, which offer support 
			for mocking static methods and final classes.
			
	2. Limited Support for Mocking Private Methods:
	Limitation: 
		* Mockito does not directly support mocking private methods, as it promotes the 
			testing of behavior rather than implementation details. It only allows spying 
			on real objects, which may call private methods.
	Workaround:
		* Refactor the code to make private methods package-private or protected, allowing 
			them to be tested indirectly through public methods.
		* Use reflection to access and invoke private methods for testing purposes, although 
			this approach may be more complex and less maintainable.
			
	3. Inability to Mock Final or Static Fields:
	Limitation: 
		* Mockito cannot mock final or static fields, as it operates at the method level and 
			does not support field mocking.
	Workaround:
		* Refactor the code to use dependency injection to provide final or static fields as 
			constructor or setter parameters, allowing them to be replaced with mock objects 
			during testing.
		* Use a different mocking library such as PowerMock or JMockit, which offer support 
			for mocking final or static fields.
			
	4. Limited Support for Mocking Enums:
	Limitation: 
		* Mockito does not directly support mocking enums, as enums are final by default and 
			Mockito cannot mock final classes.
	Workaround:
		* Use a different approach to handle enum dependencies, such as using dependency 
			injection or refactoring the code to use interfaces or abstract classes instead of enums.
		* If necessary, consider using a different mocking library or using static utility 
			methods instead of enum instances.
			
	5. Difficulty in Mocking Constructors:
	Limitation: 
		* Mockito does not provide direct support for mocking constructors, as it focuses on 
			method-level mocking rather than object creation.
	Workaround:
		* Refactor the code to use dependency injection and constructor injection to provide 
			dependencies to classes under test, allowing them to be replaced with mock objects 
			during testing.
		* Consider using a different mocking library or using PowerMock or JMockit, which offer 
			support for mocking constructors and object instantiation.
